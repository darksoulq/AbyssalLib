# Overview

In AbyssalLib, Gui logic is mostly based on Slots, whether you want to handle clicks, dragging, adding functions to clicks, or whatever else, its all done by Slots.

All guis have a list that contain these slots, and the guis are populated using this of slots under the hood, slots offer alot of freedom for behaviours, you could have an empty slot and still handle its clicks, take in only certain items into a slot, or simple only allow taking items from a slot and so on.

Next parts of the docs will cover how you can make your own guis, aswell as slots.
